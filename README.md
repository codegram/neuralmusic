# Neuralmusic

> An experiment at learning multiple aspects of a signal in parallel.


## Development workflow

First of all get the dependencies:

```bash
make deps
```

To develop this project, you want to edit the notebooks under `nbs/`. So fire up Jupyter with:

```bash
make dev
```

Once you're happy with the changes, just build the project with:

```bash
make build
```

To run the tests (any cell marked with `# test` will be considered a runnable test):

```bash
make test
```

To build the docs:

```bash
make docs
```
